- Checked for existing progress log before starting: `progress.txt` was not present.
- Added root `AGENTS.md` character sheet with role, style, stack, constraints, and workflow expectations.
- Added `infinity_tower_development_plan.md` with a structured MVP plan for the Infinity Tower incremental game, including mechanics, economy, architecture, loops, examples, and persistence notes.

- Reviewed existing `progress.txt` before starting this revision.
- Updated `infinity_tower_development_plan.md` to replace the core loop with a STR/END XP-on-damage system plus persistent Strength Prestige.
- Revised mechanics, progression, formulas, milestones, snippets, tuning, save/offline notes, and glossary to match defeat-reset behavior (reset to level 1 on loss, keep Essence + Prestige).
2026-02-17 (follow-up)
- Checked `progress.txt` before this update and applied requested prestige-system revision.
- Updated `infinity_tower_development_plan.md` so all basic stats (Strength and Endurance) now have corresponding persistent prestige tracks, gains, formulas, UI references, save fields, and offline notes.
- Aligned reset wording and glossary to the all-stats-prestige model.
2026-02-17 (next-steps planning)
- Checked `progress.txt` before starting this task per workflow instruction.
- Replaced `README.md` with an ordered 10-step execution task plan derived from existing project documentation, covering simulation, rendering, UI, upgrades, persistence, offline progress, milestones, and balancing.
