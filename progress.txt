- Reviewed existing `progress.txt` before starting this revision.
- Updated `infinity_tower_development_plan.md` to replace the core loop with a STR/END XP-on-damage system plus persistent Strength Prestige.
- Revised mechanics, progression, formulas, milestones, snippets, tuning, save/offline notes, and glossary to match defeat-reset behavior (reset to level 1 on loss, keep Essence + Prestige).
