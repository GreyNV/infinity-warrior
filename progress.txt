2026-02-12
- Checked for existing progress log before starting: `progress.txt` was not present.
- Added root `AGENTS.md` character sheet with role, style, stack, constraints, and workflow expectations.
- Added `infinity_tower_development_plan.md` with a structured MVP plan for the Infinity Tower incremental game, including mechanics, economy, architecture, loops, examples, and persistence notes.
2026-02-17
- Reviewed existing `progress.txt` before starting this revision.
- Updated `infinity_tower_development_plan.md` to replace the core loop with a STR/END XP-on-damage system plus persistent Strength Prestige.
- Revised mechanics, progression, formulas, milestones, snippets, tuning, save/offline notes, and glossary to match defeat-reset behavior (reset to level 1 on loss, keep Essence + Prestige).
2026-02-17 (follow-up)
- Checked `progress.txt` before this update and applied requested prestige-system revision.
- Updated `infinity_tower_development_plan.md` so all basic stats (Strength and Endurance) now have corresponding persistent prestige tracks, gains, formulas, UI references, save fields, and offline notes.
- Aligned reset wording and glossary to the all-stats-prestige model.
2026-02-17 (next-steps planning)
- Checked `progress.txt` before starting this task per workflow instruction.
- Replaced `README.md` with an ordered 10-step execution task plan derived from existing project documentation, covering simulation, rendering, UI, upgrades, persistence, offline progress, milestones, and balancing.
2026-02-17 (step-1 implementation)
- Checked `progress.txt` before starting this implementation task.
- Added `src/config.js` with a configurable `GAME_CONFIG` object (timing, progression, combat, rewards) and deep-merge override helper for tuning.
- Added `src/simulation.js` with deterministic, rendering-independent simulation primitives: initial state factory, enemy generation, damage formulas, XP/essence threshold helpers, combat outcome detection, and per-tick encounter resolution.
- Ran a lightweight Node ES module smoke check to verify config overrides and one tick of combat simulation execute correctly.
2026-02-17 (step-1 correction: prestige-to-xp boost)
- Checked `progress.txt` before applying this correction.
- Updated progression config to include XP conversion coefficients and prestige-based XP boost coefficients for Strength and Endurance.
- Updated simulation tick/combat events to compute and emit XP gains where each stat's prestige level boosts XP gain for its underlying run stat.
- Added and ran a Node smoke test that validates prestige multipliers are applied to XP gain formulas and exposed in tick combat events.
2026-02-17 (step-2/3 implementation)
- Checked `progress.txt` before starting this task and reviewed the AGENTS character sheet constraints.
- Expanded `src/simulation.js` with explicit run vs persistent state slices, including run XP pools, prestige XP pools, essence resource tracking, and best-floor tracking.
- Added progression handlers for run level-ups and prestige level-ups, plus victory rewards/advance and defeat reset flow that preserves persistent progression while resetting run stats and floor.
- Updated per-tick simulation flow to award run/prestige XP from combat events, resolve level-ups deterministically, and emit richer combat log events.
- Ran a Node ES module smoke simulation for several hundred ticks to validate reset/reward/progression invariants.
